mac stuck on loading screen after restart

If the issue persists, try booting your Mac in Safe Mode by shutting it down, then turning it back on while immediately pressing and holding the Shift key until the Apple logo and a progress bar appear.
 If it boots successfully in Safe Mode, the problem is likely related to third-party software or startup items, and you should consider updating macOS or uninstalling recently installed applications.

Resetting the Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) or Parameter RAM (PRAM) can also help. Shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold Option + Command + P + R for about 20 seconds, releasing the keys when you hear the startup chime for the second time.
 This resets settings like display resolution and startup disk preferences.

For disk-related issues, boot into Recovery Mode by holding Command + R during startup until the Apple logo or spinning globe appears.
 From there, open Disk Utility, select your startup disk (usually "Macintosh HD"), and run First Aid to repair disk errors.
 If Disk Utility reports repairs, restart your Mac to test the fix.

If the above steps fail, reinstalling macOS may be necessary. In Recovery Mode, select "Reinstall macOS" from the Utilities window and follow the on-screen instructions.
 This process replaces corrupted system files without erasing your personal data, though backing up your files is strongly advised.

If none of these solutions work, the issue may be hardware-related, such as a failing hard drive, RAM problem, or graphics card failure.
 In such cases, it is recommended to contact Apple Support or visit an authorized service provider for diagnosis and repair.
 Data recovery is possible using methods like Target Disk Mode with another Mac, a bootable external drive, or data recovery software, though physical drive damage may prevent recovery.



when trying to reinstall OS on recovery mode
i get this instead: 

com.apple.buildinfo.preflight.error error 21


The "com.apple.BuildInfo.preflight.error error 21" occurs when attempting to reinstall macOS from Recovery Mode, indicating a failure in the preflight check process.
 This error can stem from several causes, including an unstable internet connection, a corrupted Mac hard drive, or system glitches.
 It is particularly common when reinstalling macOS Sonoma, Ventura, or other versions.

To resolve the issue, start with basic troubleshooting steps. Restarting the Mac can clear temporary bugs that might be causing the error.
 If the problem persists, check the startup disk's format; it must be APFS for macOS High Sierra and later versions, as using a different format like Mac OS Extended (Journaled) can trigger the error.
 Running First Aid in Disk Utility within Recovery Mode can also help identify and repair disk errors.

A highly effective solution is to use Internet Recovery Mode instead of standard Recovery Mode, as it bypasses potential issues with the local recovery partition.
 For Intel-based Macs, boot into Internet Recovery by shutting down the Mac, then turning it on and immediately pressing Option + Command + R until a spinning globe appears.
 For Apple Silicon Macs, press and hold the power button until "Loading startup options" appears, then select Options and continue.
 Once in Internet Recovery, attempt to reinstall macOS again.

If the error continues, consider erasing the startup disk and reinstalling macOS. This process requires backing up data first, as it will delete all content on the Mac.
 To erase the disk, boot into Recovery Mode, open Disk Utility, select the top-level internal physical disk (e.g., Apple SSD xxx Media), and click Erase. Name the disk Macintosh HD, choose APFS as the format, and keep GUID Partition Map as the scheme.
 After erasing, return to the macOS Utilities window and select Reinstall macOS.

Resetting the NVRAM/PRAM can also help resolve the issue on Intel-based Macs. Shut down the Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold Command + Option + P + R for about 20 seconds, releasing the keys after hearing the startup chime twice.
 For Apple Silicon Macs, resetting NVRAM is not required.

In rare cases, the issue may be related to network security settings blocking necessary ports during the download, so switching to a less secure or different Wi-Fi network might help.
 If all else fails, using DFU Mode with another Mac and Apple Configurator 2 can revive the device by updating its firmware and recoveryOS without erasing data.
 If these methods are unsuccessful, contacting Apple Support is recommended.


tried internet recovery mode but still the same issue:

so trying to get my files off the mac so i can reformat the hard drive now:










everything is in /Volumes/

the mac HD and external drive

```
cp -R /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/ /Volumes/External\ Drive/
certain folder but omit the node_modules folders for the projects
that would be crazy ai, lol
```

To remove or eject an external drive from a Mac using the Terminal, you can use the diskutil command. First, identify the drive by listing all connected disks with the command diskutil list.
 This will display the disk identifiers, such as /dev/disk2, which you need to reference.

To eject the drive, use the command diskutil eject /dev/diskX, replacing X with the correct disk number.
 For example, if the drive is listed as disk2, the command would be diskutil eject /dev/disk2.
 If the drive is in use, you may need to force the eject with diskutil eject /dev/diskX force.

For a more secure removal, you can erase the entire drive using diskutil eraseDisk followed by the desired file system (e.g., APFS, ExFAT), the new drive name, and the disk identifier.
 For instance, diskutil eraseDisk APFS MyDrive /dev/disk2 will reformat the drive.
 To perform a secure erase that makes data recovery difficult, use diskutil secureErase with a level from 0 to 4, such as diskutil secureErase 4 /dev/disk2.
```bash
diskutil list
diskutil eject /dev/disk2
```



get folder size:
```bash
du -sh /path/to/folder

$ time du -sh --exclude=node_modules .  
11M     .
du -sh --exclude=node_modules .  0.00s user 0.03s system 7% cpu 0.423 total

$ time du -sh .  
570M    .
du -sh .  0.76s user 12.38s system 7% cpu 2:49.10 total

# on recovery mode
/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/usr/bin/du
```

-rwxrwxrwx 1 bruce bruce  188 Sep 19 20:36 '--exclude=node_modules'
<!-- $ rm -- '--exclude=node_modules' -->



now need to way to cp over files minus node_modules
```
mv 
cp

tar --exclude='node_modules' -czvf artoo.tar.gz test 

tar --exclude='folder' --exclude='upload/folder2' -czvf /backup/filename.tgz .
tar xzvf 
```


mount drive to wsl
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/d
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d
sudo mount -t drvfs E: /mnt/e

sudo umount /mnt/d
```


moving ssh keys
installing du on mac recovery mode

```
the binary is in /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/usr/bin/du
```





copy the folders over from mac without node_modules also .next and .venv
```
tar -czvf --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.next' --exclude='.venv' artoo.tar.gz artoo/ 
```



would be cool to get some information about the folders
cant get a version # out of du exactly but its a BSD variant on mac
can use the -I flag to exclude
```
/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/usr/bin/du -sh -I node_modules path
```

also check the disk space of the mounted volumes
```
df -h /Volumes/Drive
```




- progress

moving the rest of the files over
```


got all the files over to the external drive now

using disk utility to erase the /Volumes/Macintosh HD/

now com.apple.buildinfo.preflight.error error 21 does not happen and i can select the drive to install the OS

the OS is installed and take this time to upgrade the OS to latest Tahoe

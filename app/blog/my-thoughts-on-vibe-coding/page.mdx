# My Thoughts on Vibe Coding


Vibe Coding, it's all the rage lately. In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, it seems like there's a new buzzword popping up every other week. But *Vibe Coding* I kept hearing about it, people building entire 3D video games, letting the AI models write all the code for them! Is this the future? Is it just a gimmick? Honestly, I had to dive in and see what all the fuss was about.

Before we get started enjoy a short little demonstration.

## What is Vibe Coding?

The term "Vibe Coding" was coined by Andrej Karpathy, describing a new approach to software development where developers collaborate with AI to create applications. This method emphasizes using AI as a coding partner, letting it handle substantial portions of code generation while the developer guides the overall direction and ensures quality.

Vibe coding is more than just a trendy term. Many people are having great success with many different app building projects other than threejs 3d video games. Here's are a few examples:

It's a twist on the classic Bomberman but where your bombs paint the map like Splatoon to win.

You put in your website URL, and it spins up a multi-agent AI swarm to test for security issues.

These projects demonstrate how vibe coding isn't just limited to games or graphics - developers are successfully building everything from security tools to innovative game mechanics, showing the versatility and potential of AI-assisted development.

## My personal experience with Vibe Coding

In my development workflow, I use a combination of AI tools to enhance my coding workflow. Here are some of the tools I use:

- **Cursor**: A dedicated AI-first code editor
- **VS Code with GitHub Copilot**: Microsoft's popular editor enhanced with AI
- **Trae**: An AI programming assistant
- **V0**: 
- **Firebase Studio**:

You can think of these IDE and tools as the front end of how you interact with the models like the following:

- GPT-4
- Claude 3.5 and 3.7
- DeepSeek
- Gemini

One of the great advantages of these modern AI coding tools is their integration capabilities. When chatgpt first came I did a lot of copying and pasting to get the code I wanted. Now I can just guide the model to write the code for me.*

import PlaneDemo from '@/components/PlaneDemo';

This is a cool demo I first saw on Codrops blogs many many years ago, thought it would be fun to implement it as a react nextjs component. The demo features a stylized airplane flying above a rotating sea, surrounded by drifting clouds in a dynamic sky environment.
